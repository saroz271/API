I have used python to pull data from Harvard Art Museums API for this project. I have learned to retrieve data for my data science projects. API is something that any website can design this thing called API to give out their data and allow your web application to communicate with that data and possible even make new data too.
I started my process by installing required packages for project. I performed a get request to pull the data and converted it into the json data using python. It is then converted it into the dictionary. I was able to pull 17 variables through API request. I performed ‘dog’ as a key word search to pull specific objects in the title. I then converted it into the data frame and cleanup the data. I have prepared the final data set by creating some new data field. I have also removed null values from the data set. 
I initially had difficulties in getting the data parsed and had to try few more times. It was failing the call. I will also be working to get more comfortable with python programming in defining problem and finding solution for it.
